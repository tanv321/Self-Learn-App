# Self-Learn-App
A basic react app that will be useful for learning.

The Self-Learn-App is a rudimentary react application that is specifically designed for educational purposes. The web-based application is intended for individuals who are interested in creating their own learning materials and utilizing them to enhance their learning experience. The application is founded on the principle of user-generated Q&A input. The user is able to enter questions and answers in a text file, for instance:
Q: Provide the first five Fibonacci numbers.
A: 1,1,2,3,5
Q: Create a one-liner Python program to calculate the sum of a given list where lst = list.
A: sum(lst)

Once the user has created the text file, they can initiate the application by using the command "npm start" and navigating to the web app. Subsequently, the user can select "choose a file" and select the text file that was created earlier. Afterward, the user can click on "new question" and commence their learning endeavor.
